### Hi 👋, I'm Jennifer Powell

I'm a Frontend Engineer passionate about collaboration and delivering exceptional client experiences. After graduating Cum Laude at UC Santa Cruz (Bachelor of Business Management Economics), I obtained my CPA license and practiced as a Senior Tax Consultant at multiple firms including Deloitte. Seeking a change in career to follow my interests, I completed a 12 week Full Stack Web Development bootcamp course at UC Berkeley. I have experience working with technologies including React, Node as well as MongoDB and MySQL. I'm a continuous learner who’s looking for opportunities to further develop my professional skills at a company making a positive social impact.
